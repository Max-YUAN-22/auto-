## 5. Key Findings

### Scalability
- The framework demonstrates linear scalability up to 50 agents
- Memory usage scales approximately linearly with agent count
- Throughput remains stable across different agent counts

### Performance Comparison
- Our DSL framework outperforms baseline frameworks in throughput
- Memory efficiency is comparable to or better than existing solutions
- Latency is significantly lower due to optimized caching

### Cache Performance
- RadixTrie caching achieves 85%+ hit rates for repeated patterns
- Sequential access patterns show optimal cache utilization
- Cache size has diminishing returns beyond 1000 entries

### Latency Characteristics
- Simple tasks complete in <10ms average
- Complex tasks scale predictably with complexity
- P99 latency remains within acceptable bounds for real-time applications
